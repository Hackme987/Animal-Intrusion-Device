# Animal-Intrusion-Device


Step into the realm of advanced wildlife monitoring with our Animal Intrusion Detection System. This project utilizes state-of-the-art technology to provide a reliable solution for detecting and monitoring animal presence within a specified range.

Key Features:

Dual Ultrasonic Sensors for Precision:
Our system employs two ultrasonic sensors that work in tandem to ensure accurate and reliable detection of animals. This dual-sensor configuration enhances coverage and minimizes false positives.

Dynamic Sensor Movement with Servomotor:
Experience dynamic and responsive sensor coverage as the ultrasonic sensors are intelligently moved by a servomotor. This mechanism allows for a sweeping motion, expanding the detection range and ensuring thorough surveillance.

ESP8266 for Seamless Connectivity:
The ESP8266 serves as the brain of our system, providing seamless connectivity to the internet. Receive real-time updates and alerts about animal intrusions on your preferred devices, ensuring prompt and effective response.

LCD Screen for Immediate Feedback:
Stay informed with a built-in LCD screen that displays detailed information about detected animal presence. Receive data such as time of intrusion, sensor coverage, and any additional details to facilitate quick decision-making.

Configurable Detection Parameters:
Tailor the detection parameters to your specific needs. Adjust the sensitivity and range settings through an intuitive interface, allowing you to adapt the system to different environments and scenarios.
